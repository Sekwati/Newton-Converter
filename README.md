# Newton-Converter
Scientists measure an object’s mass in kilograms and its weight in Newton.  If you know the 
amount of mass of an object, you can calculate its weight, in Newtons, with the following formula:

Weight = Mass * 9.8

The application lets the user enter an object’s mass and then calculates the object's weight.  If 
the object weighs more than 1000 Newtons, it displays a message in a Label control indicating that 
the object is too heavy and changes the background colour of the label to red. If the object weighs less 
than 10 Newtons, it display a message in a Label control indicating that it is too light and change the 
background colour of the label to blue. Otherwise, displays the weight, and changes the background 
colour of the label to green.
